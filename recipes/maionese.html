<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Maionese is a thick, cold, and creamy sauce commonly used on sandwiches, hamburgers, composed salads, and French fries. It also forms the base for various other sauces, such as tartar sauce, fry sauce, remoulade, salsa golf, ranch dressing, and rouille. </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 egg reds</li>
    <li>2 dl of sunflower seed oil</li>
    <li>1/2 lemon</li>
    <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare your food processor.</li>
    <li>Add an egg to the bowl of your food processor and process for about 20 seconds</li>
    <li>Add lemon and salt, then process for another 20 seconds.</li>
    <li>Slowly add the oil, in tiny drops, until about a quarter of the oil has been added. Adding the oil slowly is really important. If you were to dump it all in at once, youâ€™d have mayonnaise soup!</li>
